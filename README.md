# bootstrap

This is a simple Quickstart Repository for a working gcp organization and project structure with some stacks for different use cases. This is opinionated and will not cover all cases or all things to think about but serves as a good starting point for getting your own infrastructure up and running in a decent structure already. There are many things one can adjust depending on how a business operates, but that's not something I can put in a general bootstrap. This is aimed to be usable by many, but certainly not everyone, at least not without modification. 

NOTE: this is WiP, big changes will still happen
